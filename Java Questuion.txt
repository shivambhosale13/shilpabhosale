A method that works with different data types.
6. What is an unbounded wildcard?

7. What is upper bounded wildcard?
It accepts a class and its subclasses.
8. What is lower bounded wildcard?
It accepts a class and its superclasses.
9. What is List interface?
An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements.
10. Which classes implement List?
ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector.
11. What is ListIterator?
It allows forward and backward traversal of a list.

ListIterator supports bidirectional traversal.
13. Can List store duplicates?
Yes, List allows duplicate elements.
14. What is Set interface?
A collection that does not allow duplicate elements.
15. Which Set maintains insertion order?
LinkedHashSet.
16. Can Set store duplicates?
No, duplicates are not allowed.
17. How to search element in Set?
Using contains() method.
18. Which Set is unordered?
HashSet.
19. What is Map interface?
It stores data in key-value pairs.
20. Can Map have duplicate keys?
No, keys must be unique.
21. Can Map have duplicate values?
Yes, values can be duplicated.
22. Which classes implement Map?
HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap.
23. How to get value from Map?
Using get(key) method.
24. How to iterate Map?
Using entrySet() method.
25. What is Lambda Expression?
A concise way to implement functional interfaces.
26. What symbol is used in Lambda?
Arrow operator (->).

35. How to get form data in JSP?
Using request.getParameter().
36. What is Spring Framework?
A lightweight framework for Java applications.
